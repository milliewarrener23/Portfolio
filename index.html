            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I have a 2:1 BSc degree in Bioveterinary Science, whcih is where I first experienced data analysis and loved it. I took part in a module called research methods where I was given large data sets linking to the agricultural industry and had to clean and analyse them using Genstat to provide valuble insights on the data and make reccommendations. I really enjoyed the module and knew it was something I wanted to do career wise, in my exam I got 96%. During my final year I undertook a dissertation titled Comparing Fructose, Glucose Sucrose, and Trehalose as Non-Permeating Cryoprotectants on the Integrity of Cryopreserved Equine Sperm. During the project I had to analyse a set of data collected by myself to answer my research aims and objectives. I used a using a repeated measures ANOVA linear mixed model where stallion ID was nested in ejaculate number. My overall project was graded at 70%. <section id="contact">

                    <h3>Project 2</h3>
                    <p> I analysed a large data set about the toxin and pollution levels in rivers across the world to uncover insights that can drive conservation efforts and policy recommendations. I cleaned the data and performed an array of descriptive statistics and created visualisations to comapre toxin levels of each river and over seasons to determine if there were any seasonal effects. .</p>

                    <h3>Project 3</h3>
                    <p> I analysed a large data set about a recent clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of a new treatment for type 2 diabetes. I cleaned the data first and performed an array of descrptive statistics and visualisations to compare the hb1ac levels at the start and end of the trial of each treatment group (treatment or placebo). Further more I used tests inclduing t-test, chi square test and Anova to determine if there was a signifcant difference on final hb1ac level and the frequency of adverse effects. .</p>
